    "- The append method adds an item to the end of an existing list.\n",
    "- The dot before append is there because it is a method of the list class.\n",
    "- To get the number of items in a list, you can use the len function.\n",
    "- Unlike the index of the items, len does not start with 0. So, the list above contains 5 items, meaning len will return 5.\n",
    "- len is written before the list it is being called on, without a dot.\n",
    "- The insert method is similar to append, except that it allows you to insert a new item at any position in the list, as opposed to just at the end.\n",
    "- Elements, that are after the inserted item, are shifted to the right.\n",
    "- The index method finds the first occurrence of a list item and returns its index.\n",
    "- If the item isn't in the list, it raises a ValueError.\n",
    "- There are a few more useful functions and methods for lists.\n",
    "- max(list): Returns the list item with the maximum value\n",
    "- min(list): Returns the list item with minimum value\n",
